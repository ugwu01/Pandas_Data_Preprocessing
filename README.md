# Pandas_Data_Preprocessing

Most times when datasets are collected or collated for analysis in their raw form,they are always unstructured and messy. Using data in their raw or messy format would lead to a misleading or wrong analysis. Hence, the need for data preprocesing. Pre-processing refers to the transformations applied to our data before feeding it to an algorithm. Data preprocessing is a technique that is used to convert the raw data into a clean data set. In other words, whenever the data is gathered from different sources it is collected in raw format which is not feasible for the analysis.

This is a data preprocessing project using the popular python pandas library. The project aims at showcasing my skill in data preprocessing and proper documentation of the data cleaning process.
